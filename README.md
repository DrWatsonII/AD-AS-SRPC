# AD-AS & SRPC Interactive Tool

This project is an interactive tool that illustrates the relationship between Aggregate Demand (AD), Aggregate Supply (AS), and the Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC). Students can interact with the AD and AS curves and observe how shifts in these curves affect the equilibrium point and the SRPC.

## Features
- Interactive AD and AS curves with draggable shifts.
- Dynamic display of the equilibrium point where AD = AS.
- SRPC curve that moves in response to shifts in the AS curve.
- Real-time tracking of points on the SRPC as AD and AS change.

## Instructions for Students
- Access the tool at: [https://DrWatsonII.github.io/AD-AS-SRPC/](https://DrWatsonII.github.io/AD-AS-SRPC/)
- Click and drag the AD (blue) or AS (red) curves to shift them.
- Observe how the equilibrium point changes as you move the curves.
- Notice how the orange point on the SRPC graph moves in response to changes in AD and AS.

## How to Use
1. Open the interactive tool in your browser using the provided link.
2. Drag the blue AD curve to shift the demand curve left or right.
3. Drag the red AS curve to shift the supply curve left or right.
4. Observe how changes in AD and AS affect the SRPC and the equilibrium point.

## Additional Information
This tool was developed as part of an educational module on macroeconomic principles, specifically focusing on the dynamics of the AD-AS model and the Short-Run Phillips Curve. ChatGPT helped a lot.
